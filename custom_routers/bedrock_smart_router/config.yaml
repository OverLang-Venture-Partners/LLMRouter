# Router configuration
router:
  name: bedrock_smart_router
  type: hybrid  # Rules + Memory learning
  
  # Complexity thresholds (optional tuning)
  thresholds:
    simple_max_words: 10
    reasoning_min_words: 50
  
  # Model selection strategy
  strategy: cost_optimized  # Prefer cheaper models when possible
  
  # Fallback model if routing fails
  fallback_model: nova-2-lite

# Memory configuration - Learns from routing history
memory:
  enabled: true  # Enable memory-based learning
  path: "~/.llmrouter/bedrock_router_memory.jsonl"
  
  # How memory improves routing:
  # 1. Tracks which models were selected for similar queries
  # 2. Learns patterns over time (e.g., "explain X" often needs sonnet)
  # 3. Prioritizes memory suggestions over rules when available
  # 4. Continuously improves as more queries are processed
  
  # Memory will build up patterns like:
  # - "what is" queries → nova-micro (fast, cheap)
  # - "analyze the" queries → sonnet (reasoning)
  # - "write code" queries → nova-2-lite (balanced)

# Training configuration (not used for rule-based router)
train:
  enabled: false

# Evaluation configuration
eval:
  enabled: true
  metrics:
    - accuracy
    - cost_efficiency
    - latency
    - memory_hit_rate  # % of queries using memory vs rules
